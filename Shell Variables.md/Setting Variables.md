## Setting Variables
This challenge asks me to assign the value COLLEGE to the variable PWN.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{gG9pNIoD8acEoYzAILYaydi4Iul.QX5UTN0wiN2AzNzEzW}'

Variables can be assigned values using '=' operator. There musn't be any spaces in between variable, '=', and value. Spaces would make the shell run it like a command.
```
PWN="COLLEGE"
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how to set variable to a cetain value.
