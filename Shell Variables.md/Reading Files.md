# Reading Files
This challenge read /challenge/read_me into the PWN environment variable.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{8fLpWEIsTAeUknovexXANSEzCY9.QXwIDO0wiN2AzNzEzW}'

the command /challenge/read_me is directed as the input of PWN which is later read.
```
read PWN < /challenge/read_me
```

## What I Learned
Catting can be avoided and commands can be directly read this way.
