# Reading Input
This challenge asks me to use read to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{4Rb6gAExZjL-dERTIzZINNBSket.QX4cTN0wiN2AzNzEzW}'

read builtin reads input into a variable. -p argument is used to specify a prompt. 
```
read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
```

## What I Learned
I learned how to make the shell read inputs.
