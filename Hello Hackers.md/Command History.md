# Command History
This challenge asks me to bring my flag from the history.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{I1CHFB8lkOKPRzPeJhH53l3KFmL.0lNzEzNxwiN2AzNzEzW}' <br>
I scrolled through the saved commands with the up/down arrow keys until I found the flag which was already injected in the history.

## What I learned
The command history contains the log of commands the user has run. The arrow keys can be used to navigate through them.
