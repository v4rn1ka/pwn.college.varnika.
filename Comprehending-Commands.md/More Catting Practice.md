# More Catting Practice
This challenge asks me to retrieve the flag which is hidden in the file /usr/include/arpa/flag.

## My Solve:
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{c-UX-owioJdWuvCV6ZbKCpuuv_6.QXwITO0wiN2AzNzEzW}'

This could be achieved by reading it.
Command: cat /usr/include/arpa/flag

## What I Learned
cat command can be used with absolute paths as well.
