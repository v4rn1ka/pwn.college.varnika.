# Making Directories
This challege asks me to create a directory /tmp/pwn and then a file called college and then run /challenge/run.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kyrfXzgj8mqAI7AOwQUkCtAc7sO.QXxMDO0wiN2AzNzEzW}`

I entered the tmp directory using cd command, then created a new directory using mkdir followed by creating a file named college. Finally, ran /challenge/run.
```
cd /tmp
mkdir pwn
ls
cd pwn
touch college
ls
```

## What I learned
mkdir is a command used to create directories.
