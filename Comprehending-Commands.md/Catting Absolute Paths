# Catting Absolute Paths
This challenge asks me to specify the cat command as an absolute file.
  
## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{ASNwyQctqKXPIEo2mP9kttyU2YT.QX5ETO0wiN2AzNzEzW}'

Since, the flag was already stored in the absolute path /flag, I had to read the path using cat.
Command: cat /flag

## What I Learned
Cat's arguments can be specified as absolute paths as well.
