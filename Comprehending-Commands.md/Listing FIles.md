# Listing Files
This challenge asks me to find /challenge/run which has been renamed.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8BZrB5wV9Y11KNEF3HDtdRRhSns.QX4IDO0wiN2AzNzEzW}`

/challenge remains the same so files beginning with /challenge are first listed using ls. And then 2 files appear out of which one of them is the renamed one. Hence, it is executed.
```
ls /challenge
/challenge/18418-renamed-run-31433
```
