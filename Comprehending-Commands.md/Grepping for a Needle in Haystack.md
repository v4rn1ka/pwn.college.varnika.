# Challenge Name
This challenge asks me to search for my flag using the grep command.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YbE08BbPS2tVHCB18vJNqH18C1b.QX3EDO0wiN2AzNzEzW}}`

All the flags begin with 'pwn.college' so I need to search for the key words pwn.college in the file /challenge/data.txt. 
Commands: 
```
grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
```

## What I learned
grep is a command used for searching specified text and prints it in the console
