# Tab Completion On Commands 
This challenge asks me to use tab to complete a command.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0Ds2To-r3nm8dH003QK-2llx6S_.0VN0EzNxwiN2AzNzEzW}`

I had to complete the command pwncollege so i typed it out and pressed tab. It completed my command and recieved my flag upon running it . 
```
pwncollege-22054 -->completed command
```

## What I learned
Tab command is not limited to files alone they can complete programs too.
