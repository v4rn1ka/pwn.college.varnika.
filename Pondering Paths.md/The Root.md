# The Root
This challenge asks me to invoke the pwn program using its absolute path.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{k3eO3Lwjp4-8iPj6rsNHdGR_mEx.QX4cTO0wiN2AzNzEzW}'

I typed the absolute path of pwn i.e. /pwn and recieved my flag.

## What I learned
I learnt that a program can be invoked by providing its path on the command line and also that the path that begins with the root directory(/) is the absolute path. So here, /pwn is the absolute path of the program pwn.
