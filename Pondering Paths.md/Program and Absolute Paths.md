# Program and Absolute Paths
This challenge asks me execute the file run which is inside the challenge directory.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{c4v3WNrsAI-SuuNTV6ToxV6E5T8.QX1QTN0wiN2AzNzEzW}'

Here, I first provided the outer most directory which is the challenge directory. Next, I provided the file required that is run. So, the entire path to run program is:
/challenge/run

## What I learned
I learnt to write the path of a program which is present within a directory.
