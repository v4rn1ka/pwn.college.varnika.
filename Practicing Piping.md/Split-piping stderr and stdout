# Redirecting Errors
This challenge asks me to redirect the stdout of /challenge/hack to /challenge/planet and stderr to /challenge/the.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sSKHQyuPcGQsD3hvEb5H05b1Xhw.QXxQDM2wiN2AzNzEzW}`

Temperory named pipes are created for /challenge/planet and /challenge/the using >(cmd). Since, /challenge/planet takes in stdout, > is used and 2> for /challenge/the. 
```
/challenge/hack > >(/challenge/planet) 2> >(/challenge/the)
```

## What I learned
To redirect stderr and stdout withot mixing them.
